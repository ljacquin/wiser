#' refpop data subsets documentation
#'
#' These are two data subsets, associated to 80 randomly selected genotypes from
#' the refpop original raw dataset, which are used with the wiser package for
#' illustration purposes.
#' The refpop_raw_indiv_pheno_data_subset contain raw individual phenotypic
#' measurements for these genotypes across multiple environments, countries, years,
#' management types and rows and column positions according to the experimental design.
#' On the other hand, the refpop_geno_data_subset contains uniformly sampled SNP marker data
#' for these genotypes.
